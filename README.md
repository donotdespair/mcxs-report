# mcxs-report

This is a repository for my Research Report for **ECOM90007: Macroeconometrics**. The generated website is available at: <https://yobin-tim.github.io/mcxs-report/>.

## The structure of the template repository

The repository contains several folders and files. Here's what they are for:

Folder `docs/` contains the rendered website. Do not ever adjust its contents. It's automatically generated.

File `.gitignore` includes a list of files that you might have in your local folder, but do not want them to be submitted to the public repository.

File `README.md` is the one you are reading right now. Feel free to edit this file having created your own repository from this template.

File `_quarto.yml` contains all the settings of the **quarto** project. Do not modify the existing setup unless you are sure of the consequences to the developed website. Feel free to add more detailed setup when you learn more about **quarto** over the semester.

File `index.qmd` is the quarto file in which you should develop your report. Please do not change its name or location. Otherwise modify as you will.

File `references.bib` contains **LaTeX** references to be used in the **quarto** document. Have a look at the recommendation of how to use it under the link provided in the template website. It is recommended to not change this file's name or location as they are set to the default values which make working in **RStudio** simple.

File **styles.css** contains the **CSS** style that determines the visual aspects of your website. You may modify or replace it, but please first read about it. You may also leave it as is and that's perfectly fine.
